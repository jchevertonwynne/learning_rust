## Rustlings - Quiz 2

Complete [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) up to quiz 2. Chapters 4 - 8 of [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) are a useful reference for this 

## Floodit

https://unixpapa.com/floodit/

We've created a skeleton for a terminal based floodit game which will need a few methods having their implementations defined to make the game playable.

Possible extensions are:

- add shorthands for the parsing of the colours
- make the grid size adjustable (at compile time and/or runtime)
- configurable number of colours
- floodit optimal solution solver

## Conway's game of life

[Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a classic CS cellular automaton to program. Cells can either be alive or dead, and in each iteration a cell will continue to live if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours and a dead cell will become alive if it has exactly 3 living neighbours. These simple rules can create complex turing complete behaviour

An empty repo has been provided to create an implementation of Conway's classic automata. If you get stuck ask in the channel or look at the floodit repo for a point of reference
