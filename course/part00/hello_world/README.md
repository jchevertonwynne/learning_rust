# Hello World

This is just a hello world!

Run it via `$ cargo run` or `$ cargo build && ./target/debug/helloworld` or `$ cargo build --release && ./target/release/helloworld`

Once you've confirmed your rust installation works, try setting the `NAME` environment variable and re-running the program
